  <p>How will investments in 10-year-old girls play out in the real world? What do girls and countries stand to gain or lose?</p>

  <p>Imagine a girl, who, like her country, is at a pivotal point in her life and development, and consider the different paths her future might take over the next 15 years.</p>

  <p>This girl, Gayatri, is 10 and lives with her parents, grandparents, two brothers, and sister in a village in India. Her parents completed primary school and are now agricultural workers. The household has little disposable income after paying for food, housing, clothing and medical expenses. Depending on the support she receives, Gayatri may have two very different futures ahead of her.</p>

            Thanks to a conditional cash transfer programme, Gayatri’s parents have a financial incentive to make sure she attends school regularly; the family is able to use the extra money for food and school supplies for the children. Gayatri also learns about a competitive secondary school scholarship that will be offered to girls from her village. She decides to study hard for the exams—her parents and teachers are supportive. Gayatri also begins to attend a community programme for girls, where she starts to learn about reproductive health—including puberty, pregnancy, contraceptive use and sexually transmitted infections—decision-making and life skills.

            Gayatri’s parents warn that, although secondary school will be tuition-free, expenses for books, uniforms and related items will be higher than those associated with primary school. Although her parents would like all of their children to attend secondary school, they realize that this may not be possible. Because they believe that Gayatri’s brothers will have better employment prospects, they prioritize their sons’ education over that of their daughters.

            Having left school, <strong>Gayatri weds a 20-year-old man</strong> from a neighbouring village in a marriage arranged by her family and that of the young man. Gayatri’s parents are especially keen on the match because the groom’s family is not asking for a dowry, which will considerably ease the financial burden on Gayatri’s family.

            Amid pressure from her in-laws to have children shortly after marriage, <strong>Gayatri gives birth to her first child.</strong> The pregnancy is difficult and takes a toll on her health.

            With the approval of her family, Gayatri <strong>chooses to marry</strong> a 23-year-old man from a neighbouring village. In part because of the income she is bringing in, she feels confident in expressing her opinion and making household decisions. Because of the reproductive and sexual health education she received as a young adolescent, she is also able to confidently discuss delaying childbearing with her husband, countering family pressures to have her first child immediately after getting married. She succeeds in <strong>practising contraception</strong> to delay her first pregnancy until she and her husband become better acquainted with each other and their finances are more secure.
          </div>
          <div class="year-bottom-data element-invisible">
            Gayatri works intermittently as <strong>an unskilled labourer</strong> to help support her family, but work is generally inconsistent because of her household responsibilities.

            Gayatri <strong>gives birth to her first child;</strong> she takes some time off work to care for the baby, but plans to return. She and her husband would like to have another child, but decide not to do so for at least another two or three years.
          </div>
          <div class="year-bottom-data element-invisible">
            Gayatri, <strong>pregnant with her third child,</strong> wants to discuss birth control options with her husband, but he expresses disapproval. Worried that he may become violent, she does not bring it up again.

            Although her daughter is still very young, Gayatri, now working again, hopes to be able to provide her with an education that is at least as good as the one she had.

          <div class="year-bottom-data element-invisible">
            Gayatri is now the mother of three children, and household finances are tight, just as they were in her parents’ house when she was a child. Her oldest child, a 9-year-old girl, attends primary school. Gayatri hopes that she will be able to give her daughter the continued education that she was unable to have, but is worried that this will be impossible, both because of money and because her household will increasingly rely on their daughter to help with the household chores and with the younger children.

  <p>Even though Gayatri is not a real person, she is representative of tens of millions of girls in India and low- and middle-income countries the world over. And while every girl in every country has unique circumstances, potential and challenges, it is possible to make informed predictions about what each stands to lose or to gain.</p>

  <p>With the additional earnings expected through path 1, Gayatri will be able to save money as a fallback for future emergencies, to help support parents and grandparents, or to invest in education for herself or her children—this is made easier by the fact that she has fewer children than in path 2. In addition, in path 1, Gayatri’s children are more likely to be healthier and better educated than if Gayatri had not benefited from these initial investments in her human capital, kicking off a virtuous cycle and allowing her family to escape poverty.</p>
