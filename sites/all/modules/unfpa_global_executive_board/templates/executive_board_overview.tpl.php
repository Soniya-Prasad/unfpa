  <?php print t("The Executive Board provides intergovernmental support and supervision for the activities of UNDP, UNFPA, and UNOPS in accordance with the policy guidance of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and the United Nations Charter. The Executive Board ensures that UNDP, UNFPA and UNOPS remain responsive to the evolving needs of programme countries, and supports the work of UNFPA in delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe, and every young person's potential is fulfilled.   General Assembly resolution 48/162 of 20 December 1993 created the Executive Board, which consists of representatives from 36 countries who serve on a rotating basis. The Executive Board superseded the 48-member Governing Council on 1 January 1994. The Governing Council previously served as the governing body for UNFPA from 1973 to 1993."); ?>
