      <p>Every day, some 500 women and girls die from childbirth and pregnancy in areas affected by, or prone to, conflict or natural disaster. In these settings, women and girls are often cut off from health care and exposed to trauma, malnutrition and disease. But their lives can be saved with access to quality sexual and reproductive health services. <span class="highlighted-text">Join us in protecting women's and girls' rights to health, safety and dignity in emergencies.</span></p>
      <p>The Safe Birth Even Here campaign aims to raise awareness of the high rate of maternal deaths in emergency situations and increase support for  services to protect the rights of the women and girls living in humanitarian and fragile settings. It was created in 2012 by UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, and refreshed in 2016 with the creative talents of Benetton. During the next five years, we will bring you news and updates as we come together with people and leaders from around the world to ensure Safe Birth Even Here in emergencies.</p>
